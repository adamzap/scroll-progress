Scroll Progress - A Chrome Extension
====================================

Purpose
-------

When activated, this extension will display what percentage of the page you
have scrolled down next to the address bar. It updates as you scroll.

I suppose it's useful for reading very long articles.

Note
----

It *mostly* works right now.
